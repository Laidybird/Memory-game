The aim of this game is to provide a responsive, easy to use and easy to learn website that is aesthetically pleasing and entertaining for to the users.I wanted the game to be easy to play and have a good layout. The Game can be played by all ages. The reason I choose the Halloween theame is that I think its fun and allso has a referance to Transilvania a place that it means a lot to me.
This Game was build as a Milestone project #2 (Java script Esentials) for Diploma in Full Stack Development at Code Institute.The theame of the Game is Halloween. 

## Tools Used: HTML5, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT.

## Ready to beggin
To play the Game you have to match the images in 100 seconds. If you match them in 100 seconds or less you win.
I also create a flip counter that records in how many flips you won.

# Typoghraphy

For the Typoghraphy I used [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+Spray+Paint#styles) and I choosed the Rubik Spray Paint font as I belive it has a bit of dramatic look and it meets the criteria I choose to follow for the Game. Also has a clean easy to read style.

# Colors 

The colors I chose it had to meet the criteria of the Game but still be nice and pleasant for the users eyes.
For the Game title and overay Messages I used #FF6D00 and for the game timmer and flips I used #FFBB89.

# Future Features

In the future I want to add a volume control function and a game record function that enables the player to record his winnings and provide feedback.
